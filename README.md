## Contents

### **1. Python Lists**
Practice computing statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) using only built-in Python functionality—no external libraries.

### **2. Dictionaries**
- Convert structured records into dictionaries for easier data handling.  
- Implement a simple search or filter to identify the record with the maximum numeric value (e.g., longest book).

### **3. NumPy and the Iris Dataset**
Work with real-world tabular data using NumPy:
- Import and separate numerical and categorical data.  
- Split arrays by category labels for analysis.

### **4. Statistical Analysis with NumPy**
Compute summary statistics and correlations across groups to compare species characteristics and relationships between variables.

### **5. Derived Data Columns**
Create new computed fields from existing NumPy data columns (e.g., calculating derived metrics such as “volume”).
